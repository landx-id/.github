# ⭐️ LandX Open Source Repositories

We love Open Source. Our technology stacks are mostly Open Source, including Erlang, Python, Javascript (ReactJS, Tailwind, or Svelte), Flutter, or even Kubernetes, all with their own dependencies.

So we have obligations to give back to the community, even in a very small contribution. We have opensourced some libraries/packages, and they are used internally in our daily operations, such as:

1. [Privy Python SDK](https://github.com/landx-id/privy-python-sdk)
2. [Moka Python SDK](https://github.com/landx-id/moka-python-sdk)
3. [Xfers Python SDK](https://github.com/landx-id/xfers-python-sdk) (Now [Fazz](https://fazz.com/))
4. [PgBouncer Chart for GKE](https://github.com/landx-id/pgbouncer-chart-gke)
5. and many more..

We even publish a small documentation about our internal Engineering Culture and Workflows that you can check on https://github.com/landx-id/landx-engineering-culture

Use them freely, and Happy coding!
